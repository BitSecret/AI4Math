The essence of intelligence is **abstract ability** and **reasoning ability**, which are the basis of learning. With
abstract ability, we can build a static image of the objective world in the subjective world. With the ability of
reasoning, we can simulate the dynamic changes of the objective world in the subjective world, and then make "
predictive" decisions.

The essence of intelligence is abstract and reasoning, and the ultimate embodiment of human abstract and reasoning
ability is **mathematics**. Therefore, exploring how AI solves mathematical problems is a feasible way to realize AGI.  

This repository collects the latest research progress on AI4Math, including papers, workshops, benchmarks, and more.
